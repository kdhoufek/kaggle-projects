This was my first submission for a Kaggle competition that wasn't directed. 
Got a 0.95960 accuracy score on the submission, which wasn't terrible, but definitely not the best in the group. 
Can't upload the data files as they are too large (about 3 million rows), but they are linked in the notebook written via Kaggle. Not sure anyone could access them without access to the competition though.
